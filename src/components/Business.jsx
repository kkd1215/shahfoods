          India's Pharmaceutical Industry: An overview -Size of India's
          pharmaceutical sales were an estimated $20 billion in2014 and the
          forecast indicates an average growth of 10.3 percent annually in
          2014-18 (in nominal local-currency terms) to reach $33.8 billion. This
          growth will be driven by increasing personal incomes and the
          escalation of chronic diseases. India's pharmaceutical market is
          dominated by generic drugs, which account for around 75 percent of the
          market by volume. Supplied mainly by domestic companies, generics have
          helped to keep pharmaceutical prices low and the market is expected to
          continue expanding rapidly. Still, India's growing middle class is
          increasing demand for more advanced and costly medicines. Although
          domestic pharmaceutical companies were established primarily to supply
          the local market, they have taken advantage of their low labor and
          research costs to export generic drugs to developed countries, notably
          the U.S, its largest export market. India is also a major supplier to
          other emerging markets and has become the biggest supplier to UN
          health care programs. Domestic and international pharmaceutical
          companies operating in India face issues ranging from the new Drug
          Price Control Order (DPCO), which prescribes a ceiling on the prices
          of several essential medicines, to drug and clinical trial quality,
          patent issues, and the misclassification of medical devices.
